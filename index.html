              <br> 
              <p class="lead">         Smartphones have come a long way since their inception. Here's a brief history:
                    The concept of a "smart" phone traces back to the IBM Simon Personal Communicator, which was introduced in 1992. It combined basic mobile phone functions with the ability to send and receive emails.
                    The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the rise of devices like the Nokia 9000 Communicator and BlackBerry, known for their email capabilities and physical keyboards.
                    In 2007, Apple's iPhone revolutionized the industry with a touchscreen interface and the App Store, ushering in the era of modern smartphones.
                    Android entered the scene in 2008, providing an open-source alternative to iOS, leading to fierce competition and innovation in the market.
                    Over the years, smartphones have evolved with larger, high-resolution displays, powerful processors, improved cameras, and features like facial recognition and augmented reality.
                     Today, smartphones are essential devices that connect us to the world, offering capabilities far beyond just making calls, from productivity and entertainment to health and fitness tracking.</p>

                       <p id="content content1">The foldable phone market is heating up this year with the likes of Google and OnePlus joining the fray. That brings some much-needed competition to what has, for the past few years, been a one-man show, owned and operated by Samsung. That also means that Samsung's foldables come with a touch more refinement and features, with the latest Galaxy Z Fold 5 being the embodiment of just that.

                        Compared to the competition, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 fields greater multitasking features and opportunities to leverage the larger internal display. Being the fifth generation model of the Z Fold series also means that the latest device is not only more polished by design -- with a thinner and lighter form factor than ever before -- but is more durable. Samsung says the Z Fold 5 has a sturdier hinge mechanism now, allowing the device to withstand up to 200,000 folds. </p>

           <p id="content content1"> The new iPhone 15 Pro Max offers everything a premium flagship smartphone should. The 6.7-inch model is the largest of the iPhone 15 line and comes stacked with the latest features that Apple has to offer. It looks and feels different from the prior Pro Max models, as it's made of titanium instead of stainless steel. This makes the iPhone 15 Pro Max noticeably lighter, ZDNET Editor-in-Chief Jason Hiner noted in his review.

            Another major new feature for iPhone 15 Pro Max is the USB-C connector, which supports faster charging and data transfers, the ability to charge AirPods Pro 2 (with new USB-C case) and Apple Watch from your iPhone, and the ability to connect an external 4K monitor to your iPhone.  </p>

The latest model comes with 100W SuperVooc fast charging or 80W in the US, which is still great. 

            For reference, the highest-end iPhone 15 Pro Max has a charging speed limit of 30W and Samsung's Galaxy S23 Ultra caps out at 45W. </p>
